# AlienPyFX

This is a python fork and further enhancement of hack-alienfx projects.

This project is being built to provide a GUI LED management system, along with a python implementation of libusb to enact lighting changes.

Current Release:
 Currently this program allows for applying theme files to at least alienware 13 R2 laptops.  Multiple other platforms have been proven to have been supported by the same method being used by this software.  If you notice a platform that is not listed or is not working, please submit an issue.
